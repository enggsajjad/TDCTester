NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity -
   e.g. two LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.
   When assembling slices, Map gives priority to combine logic that
   is related.  Doing so results in the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin
   packing unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are
   occupied through related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through
   related logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely
   utilized.  Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until
   all usable LUTs and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing
   budget, increased levels of unrelated logic packing may adversely
   affect the overall timing performance of your design.

Section 1 - Errors
------------------

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:Pack:1402 - The register teststop_1 has the property IOB=TRUE, but was
   not packed into the output side of an I/O component. Register teststop_1 has
   INITSTATE equal to LOW.  The IOB does not support FDS unless INITSTATE equals
   HIGH.
WARNING:Pack:1402 - The register teststop_2 has the property IOB=TRUE, but was
   not packed into the output side of an I/O component. Register teststop_2 has
   INITSTATE equal to LOW.  The IOB does not support FDS unless INITSTATE equals
   HIGH.
WARNING:Pack:1402 - The register teststop_3 has the property IOB=TRUE, but was
   not packed into the output side of an I/O component. Register teststop_3 has
   INITSTATE equal to LOW.  The IOB does not support FDS unless INITSTATE equals
   HIGH.
WARNING:Pack:1402 - The register teststop has the property IOB=TRUE, but was not
   packed into the output side of an I/O component. Register teststop has
   INITSTATE equal to LOW.  The IOB does not support FDS unless INITSTATE equals
   HIGH.

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:LIT:95 - All of the external outputs in this design are using slew rate
   limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical outputs can be
   dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs in the schematic.
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
   2 block(s) optimized away

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

Optimized Block(s):
TYPE 		BLOCK
GND 		XST_GND
VCC 		XST_VCC

To enable printing of redundant blocks removed and signals merged, set the
detailed map report option and rerun map.
