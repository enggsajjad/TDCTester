# TDCTester
Time to Digital Converter TDC Tester based on Microcontroller and FPGA


##		Time-to-Digital Converter (TDC) Time Measurement Unit
Brief Description:	Implementation of TDC (1ns resolution) using gate delay lines in Spartan-II FPGA
Detail:	The purpose is to determine the time elapsed between to signal with a precision of 1ns. This is achieved by implementing traditional gate delay line in FPGA and the user interaction is controlled via microcontroller. Microcontroller is used to send different commands to FPGA and read back the time readings and send them to LCD display or to computer.
Key Hardware:	8051 Microcontroller, Spartan-III FPGA, Keypad, LCD, SD card
